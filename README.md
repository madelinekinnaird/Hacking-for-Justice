# Hacking-for-Justice

In 2018, I attended an event put on by the [Cook County State Attorney’s Office](https://www.cookcountystatesattorney.org/) focusing on the SAO’s public case-level data. It was a super informative, caffeine-filled couple of days. It was also my first time learning and using R - oh the memz!

I put together [this blog](https://footnotesweb.wordpress.com/2018/09/24/hacking-for-justice-an-intro-into-chicagos-criminal-justice-data/) together hoping to share some of the things I learned. It’s structured as a “couch to 5k” type exercise — from the very fundamentals of R to an analysis of monthly drug felonies by race.
